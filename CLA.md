## 4. Tacos: Contribution Recognition Program

### 4.1 What Are Tacos?
Tacos 🌮 are our way of saying "thank you" and tracking who has contributed to TACo projects. Think of them like a reputation score or community credits — not a currency.

### 4.2 How Tacos Work
- Contributions earn tacos based on scope, quality, and impact
- Your taco balance reflects your contribution history
- Balances are recorded in our contributor ledger
- Tacos are awarded for accepted contributions. If your code is not accepted, you unfortunatly not given Tacos. 

### 4.3 What Tacos Are NOT
Tacos are:
- **Not money** — they have no cash value and cannot be purchased
- **Not transferable** — tied to your contributor identity
- **Not an investment** — there is no expectation of profit
- **Not a contract** — earning tacos creates no obligation on TACo's part

### 4.4 Possible Recognition
At our sole discretion, we may choose to recognize contributors with high taco balances through:
- Invitations to paid contract work (granted we can!)
- Revenue sharing programs (if established)
- Access to paid bounty programs (if established)
- Grants or stipends
- Early access or special roles

These are possibilities, not promises. 
Due to the nature of these projects at this point of time, we can make no guarentees
but would love to reward our contributers and approach recruitment, work-life and app building
in a completely different way.
