### What Tacos Are

- A record of your contribution history
- A "thank you" from the community
- Possibly considered for future opportunities (no promises)

### What Tacos Are NOT

- Not money (no cash value)
- Not transferable
- Not a guarantee of anything

### Checking Your Balance

View the [Contributor Ledger](https://github.com/Thoughtful-App-Co/contributor-ledger) (or ask a maintainer).
