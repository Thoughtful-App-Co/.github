## Building Technology That Enables, Not Enslaves

We're an open contribution venture studio creating applications that respect your time, attention, and autonomy. Technology should enhance life, not hijack it. Our intent is to use this next sesmic shift in code mechanis propelled by LLM code agents to take back 

### üéØ Our Mission

- **Respectful Design**: Build apps that solve problems
- **Phone As a Server**: Building for future, low screen time approaches. Using wearables (haptics, audio, "dumb" screens) and notifictions on phone to give you more time 
- **The New Bundle**: Big tech loves creating bundles, we will bundle all Thoughful Apps into a marketing package similar to thier models (pick one, three, all apps etc).
- **Transparent Funding**: Will strive to give contributers access to community rounds for each company with full visibility
- **New Hiring Models**: Using hackathons, open-source and more grass roots approach, find mission motiavted individuals to ensure these projects are successful.
- **Humane Technology**: Put human wellbeing before engagement metrics
- **Incentivize the Open-Source Concept**: General communities are not incentivized outside of the greater good. Our venture studio beleives in incentivized community participation.
- **Adopt Local-First Principles When Possible**: Like most for-profit companies, we will not state being local-first in all 7 tenents but will strive to approach the full monty when plausible.
